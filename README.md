Introduction
------------

Each of the samples in this repository is associated with a codelab exercise
from the Android Fundamentals in Kotlin course.

The Android Fundamentals in Kotlin course can be used for self-study, or as the 
basis of an instructor-led training. It is targeted towards beginning Android 
developers with a background in software development or computer science with 
at least two years of experience with a modern, object-oriented programming
language, such as the Java programming language,
and familiarity with basic software architecture principles. 

Since this course is in Kotlin, it is assumed you know Kotlin at the level 
taught in the Udacity course, 
[Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011).
